# test-pages

This repository was created for testing publishing web pages on GitHub Pages.  
The structure is simple, it is composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is confirmed whether easy operation is possible.  
At the time of publication, the commit log may be very dirty because we are also checking the operation of the git command.  
Please note.
